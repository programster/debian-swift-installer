Debian Swift Installer
======================

This project is just a set of bash scripts to go along with some instructions on a tutorial that will be posted on Programster.blogspot.com to help with setting up your own object storage cluster. I have used the MIT licence so that people or organizations can extend or use the project without worrying about licencing issues.

This is not currently a working project.
